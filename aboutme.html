            <p>My Name is Anita, I am a Web and Mobile Developer. My journey with code began 5 years ago. After leaving school to figure out what I wanted to do. I began working at Clearly Innovative just doing admin work, filing and answering the phone. <br><br>From there my I progressivley took on more tasks and became the Office Manager. When I first began working with the company programming seemed like such a bore. I never thought I woud be interested in code until I saw someones' idea go from ideation to a physical product. <br><br> After I saw that I decided that I wanted to become a developer. Initially I tried to begin learning Titanium (cross-platfrom tool) but I took a step back and realized I needed to start small. I taught myself HTML/CSS and began to read and watch anything I could about development. For a year and a half I taught myself. The opportunity came to me to fill one of the Jr. Development apprentice roles at my company and train to began my career as a developer. <br><br> I have finished my training and I am ready to start this journey! </p>
